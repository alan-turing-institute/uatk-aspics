This tool opens up new challenges/possibilities where external models (multi-level) like Agent-based models -ABM now can be tested in multi regions. However in models with location parameters striclty dependend on the population interactions, internal validation and calibrations process are seen as a relevant and requiered to properly tune this national behaivor.
